## The Best Way to Learn Textual

### 1. **Start with the Official Tutorial**
- Go through the [Textual Tutorial](https://textual.textualize.io/tutorial/) which provides a comprehensive introduction
- Follow the official [Getting Started guide](https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/) 
- The tutorial includes a video series that covers the same content

### 2. **Study the Examples**
Based on what I saw in the documentation, the best approach is to examine existing examples:
- The "Pride" example shows basic layout concepts
- The calculator example demonstrates a complete application with styling
- Look at the built applications like Posting, Toolong, Memray, Dolphie, and Harlequin to understand real-world usage

### 3. **Progressive Learning Approach**
1. **Begin with simple examples** - Start with basic apps like the pride flag example
2. **Learn the calculator example** - This shows how to handle user input and state management
3. **Study the CSS styling system** - Textual uses a CSS-like system for styling
