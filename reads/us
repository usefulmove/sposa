You stand in your own skin.
A single heartbeat.
A quiet room.
It feels safe here.
It feels separate.
But listen closer.
Silence is not empty.
It is a bridge.

We tell ourselves a story.
That we are islands.
Drifting.
Alone in the deep.
But the water connects the islands.
The roots tangle in the dark.
Beneath the surface.
Where it matters.
We are already touching.

I am.
Because you are.
My joy is an echo of yours.
Your grief is a shadow on my wall.
We are not distinct.
We are notes in the same chord.
Rising.
Falling.
Creating the music together.
Take away one note.
And the song collapses.

We build high walls.
Stone by stone.
Fear is the mortar.
We think they protect us.
But they only hide us.
They keep the pain out.
Yes.
But they keep the light out too.
And it is dark inside the fortress.
Cold.
Lonely.

To be seen.
Really seen.
Is terrifying.
It asks you to lower the shield.
To drop the weapon.
To stand with open hands.
Vulnerable.
Shaking.
Real.
But this is the only way.
The only way the warmth gets in.

Look at the stranger.
The one you pass on the street.
They carry a universe inside.
Galaxies of memory.
Constellations of regret.
Just like you.
They are fighting a battle.
You cannot see.
Just like you.
Be kind.
It is the only truth that lasts.

We are woven from the same thread.
Spun from the same star.
There is no "them".
There is only "us".
Broken pieces.
Looking for the pattern.
Fitting together.
Finally whole.

Reach out.
Cross the gap.
The distance is an illusion.
You are not alone.
You never were.
You never will be.
Welcome home.
To each other.
Us.
