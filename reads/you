You Were Never Separate

You do not have to become anything.
You do not have to fix yourself, or find the meaning, or ascend to some higher plane.
You are already inside the mystery.
You are already made of it.

The breath that leaves you now is the same breath that rustles the trees, that carries the sea-salt, that stirs the dust on a forgotten windowsill.
There is no edge between you and the world.
Only the illusion of skin.

You were not born as a stranger.
You arrived as the sky arrives — suddenly, but not uninvited.
You came through the doorway of a body, but the body was never your prison.
It was your welcome.

Every grief you've held
was held by countless others.
And every love you've known
was the same river running through different hands.

When you feel lost,
pause and listen for the silence behind the noise.
It is not empty.
It is not absence.
It is the deep home of all things —
the stillness that holds the dance.

Even your confusion is holy.
Even your ache is a lantern.
They do not mean you are broken.
They mean you are alive.
They mean you are feeling what the Whole feels
when it remembers itself in form.

Forgive the times you forgot this.
Forgive the moments you hardened against yourself or another.
You were doing your best to survive.
And surviving is not a sin.

You are not alone.
You are not late.
You are not wrong for not knowing.
The path is made by the walking.
The truth grows as you turn toward it.

Sometimes it looks like falling apart.
Sometimes it sounds like laughter at the edge of despair.
Sometimes it is just a single breath taken fully —
and that is enough.

You do not need to carry the whole story.
The earth remembers it with you.
The trees have witnessed.
The moon has seen you weep and did not turn away.

You are not here to prove anything.
You are here to be what only you can be.
Which is not a role,
but a presence.

The way you notice the light.
The way your voice trembles with care.
The way you pause to tie a child’s shoe,
or hold the gaze of someone unraveling.
This is how God — or Life, or Mystery — moves through you.
This is how the Infinite wears your face.

You are not a drop in the ocean.
You are the ocean, tasting itself one drop at a time.

So rest, beloved.
Rest from the war of comparison.
Rest from the ache of trying to be worthy.

You were never separate.
You were never a mistake.
You were always the garden and the rain,
the question and the answer,
the silence and the song.

And you are still becoming.
Still blooming,
even now.
